Processing:
  Processing Description: Cast by induction skull melting. Rolled at 850C in beta-phase
    field (beta-processed). Annealed at 750C for 5 days with furnace cooling (beta-processed
    and annealed). Rolled at 725C to 50% reduction and 75% reduction, with 4 passes
    of 16% reduction at each stage. Heating for 1 hour at the start, then 2 mins between
    passes. Air cooled after rolling. Annealed samples heat-treated (HT) at 750C for
    2 hours with furnace cooling.

  - casting
  - hot-rolling
  - annealing
